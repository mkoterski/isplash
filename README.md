# koteshi-san
Your friendly little raspberry pi gardener.

Description:
Koteshi-san is a collection of tools that I found helpful in building my automatic plant watering system using a raspberry pi 4 which I had lying around.

Status: Work in progress

Must-have
- multiple plants can be watered
- Measuring:
-- Soil moisture
-- Soil temperature
-- air humidity
-- air temperature
- Logs can be viewed (history of moisture levels)
- Can run fully autonomous for one week!

Nice to have
- Nice "body" for the solution to make it look less DIY
- Remote control possible (App or webclient)
- measure water reservoir's ph value
