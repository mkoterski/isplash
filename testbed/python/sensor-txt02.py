# Simple test to write readings from a BME280 sensor to a .txt files
# If log file does not exists yet, it will be created
# 
# Last Update: 2020-11-11
# Modified by: Matthias Koterski
#
# Change log: 
# 
# 0.1a - Initial WIP version.
#
# Requirements:
# 1. Raspberry Pi B+ model
# 2. Sensor (BME280)
# 3. Jumper cables
# 4. BME280 library (run "pip3 install RPi.bme280" to install necessary libraries)
